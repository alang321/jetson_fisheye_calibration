# For image processing and video capture (MUST be built/installed WITH GStreamer support on the client)
opencv-python

# Numerical operations, often a dependency of OpenCV and used directly
numpy

# Python bindings for GObject libraries (like GStreamer, GLib)
# Required by server.py. Needed by control.py only if using GStreamer directly via gi,
# not strictly required if *only* using cv2.VideoCapture with GStreamer backend.
# NOTE: Installation often requires system packages (see below).
